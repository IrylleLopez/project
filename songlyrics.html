		<h4>TALKING TO THE MOON</h4>
		<hr/>
	
		<p>[Verse1]</p>
		<p>I know you're somewhere out there</br>
		Somewhere far away</br>
		I want you back</br>
		I want you back</br>
		My neighbors think I'm crazy</br>
		But they don't understand</br>
		You're all I had</br>
		You're all I had</p>
	
		<p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
		<p>At night when the stars light up my room</br>
		I sit by myself</p>
	
		<p>[CHORUS]</p>
		<p>talking to the moon</br>
		Tryna get to you</br>
		In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too</br>
		Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?</p>
	
		<p>[Verse2]</p>
		<p>I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town</br>
		They say I've gone mad</br>
		Yeah, I've gone mad</br>
		But they don't know what I know</br>
		'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back</br>
		Yeah, they're talking back, oh</p>
	
		<p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
		<p>At night when the stars light up my room</br>
		I sit by myself</p>
	
		<p>[Chorus]</p>
		<p>Talking to the moon</br>
		Tryna get to you</br>
		In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too</br>
		Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?</p>
	
		<p>[Bridge]</p>
		<p>Do you ever hear me calling?</br>
		Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh</br>
		Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon</p>
	
		[Chorus]
		<p>Still trying to get to you</br>
		In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too</br>
		Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?</p>
	
		[Outro]
		<p>Oh-oh</br>
		I know you're somewhere out there</br>
		Somewhere far away</p>
